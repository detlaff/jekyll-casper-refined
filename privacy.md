The privacy of my visitors is extremely important, simply because I care as much for my own. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information that is received and collected and how it is used. First and foremost, I will **never** share your email address or any other personal information to anyone without your direct consent, whenever you use that way of communication to reach me. Period.

### Log Files

Like many other websites, my blog uses log files to help learn about when, from where and how often traffic flows to this site. The information in the log files include:

* Internet Protocol addresses (IP)
* Types of browser
* Internet Service Provider (ISP)
* Date and time stamp
* Referring and exit pages
* Number of clicks

All of this information is not linked to anything that is personally identifiable and hosted on my own server. To this end, I am using an open-source analytics platform called [Piwik](http://piwik.org).
