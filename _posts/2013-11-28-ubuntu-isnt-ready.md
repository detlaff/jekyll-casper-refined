title: "Why isn’t Ubuntu ready for me (yet)"

**Disclaimer**: I absolutely love Ubuntu and pretty much every other GNU/Linux distribution out there. I have used anything from Arch to Mint and it’s safe to say that I’m no newbie. Hence, this piece is not made to start a flame war, but to remind that there are still some things — most of them likely well known — left to do until *most people* are ready to use Linux (even in it’s most friendly form).

### Office Work

As it happens, Microsoft Office is the de facto standard when it comes to office suites, which is a problem in itself for Linux users. Yes, you can run [Word and the rest through Wine](http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&iId=10), but this solution is neither perfect nor long-term/native. My work, for example, requires me to use Google Docs for most stuff, but I still have to dabble in specific Word tools like the Review section (for example comments, tracking changes). Trying to import a well-formatted and commented .docx to LibreOffice ends in a document which is nothing like the original. Pictures are somewhere else, charts or tables are broken too, don’t even get me started — tl;dr it looks like shit.

So what to do? Well, I cannot reliably use **LibreOffice**, because my co-workers don’t even know what it is. I could use Wine to get Word up and running, but I can’t get 2010 to install and 2007 (even patched) could not save as a PDF in this environment — which is often pretty vital for me. Result? **Utter shit**. Unless you work with people who respect your choice of software and/or use things you do, you’re pretty much screwed in this department. I really wish someone ends this .docx-.odt war by consolidating formats (*yeah, right*).

### Critical Software

This is a delicate subject since it is different on a person to person basis. Moreover, I can’t blame Canonical, Red Hat or OpenSUSE that I can’t use a particular application on Linux. There is a metric ton of people using **Photoshop** in their daily work or life. **GIMP** is fantastic as it is, especially given its price of 0,00$, yet I doubt it’s going to conquer hearts of die-hard Mac OS X hypothetical converts used to Photoshop or Pixelmator (if OS X is good for something, it’s designing, but apart from being a toy for hipster techno-wizards, that’s pretty much it). Same goes for software like ArchiCAD, Adobe Premiere, 3ds Max and so on. I guess companies just don’t see the profit.

### Gaming

I’m happy to report that at least in the gaming industry [something is finally happening](http://store.steampowered.com/livingroom/SteamOS/).

> SteamOS combines the rock-solid architecture of Linux with a gaming experience built for the big screen

THANKS VALVE.

But seriously — this is amazing and everyone was eagerly waiting for such an event to happen for years. One of the biggest companies in the industry is pushing *away from Windows*. Which, in turn, created an incentive for more players, big and small alike, to port their games over. As it turns out, there’s a ton of Linux users who really like games. Oh my, who would’ve thought! In all Humble Bundle promotions to date, Linux lags behind Windows and Mac in total purchases, but [dwarfs both platforms](http://cheesetalks.twolofbees.com/humble/) when it comes to the average payment — sure, they may use free operating system, but they are not cheap. An important thing to point out is that display drivers, which up to this point were not of amazing quality (to put it lightly) may see a solid improvement as Nvidia is already working with Valve to increase performance.

### Conclusion

If this piece piqued your interest on the subject, take a look at [this article](http://linuxfonts.narod.ru/why.linux.is.not.ready.for.the.desktop.current.html) summarizing main Linux problems on the desktop as of this year (warning: wall of mostly technical text), since my post barely scratches the surface. To be honest, I can’t say I hate Windows — I use it every single day—but the direction Microsoft is going with 8.x worries me a bit. Touch interface is fine, I have an iPad, but including it by default in a desktop OS is a stupid idea.

I use Office Suite and I play a ton of games, I Skype, chat, stream, I browse the web and manage my VPS. Where to run then? Apple? **Waaay** to expensive for what it’s worth (and I am not a designer). Linux? In a few months, maybe a year…
