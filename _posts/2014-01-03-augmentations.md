I wanted to start this game for years now, but everytime I began, something in my life or work distracted me and I simply stopped. Which is a pity, since **Deus Ex: Human Revolution** is one of the best, let's say, sci-fi RPGs around, especially given that I loved the original title, all of its freedoms and choices. I am not sure about one thing, though. The *sci-fi* description it not entirely accurate in this case and I feel compelled to tell you why.

First off, **Human Revolution** is set in 2027 and most of us will live long enough to see that year. People born in 90's, my age, are going to be the ones in power that year. Hence, it'll be up to us to face and decide about problems described in this very game — problems not so distant even today, in 2014, thirteen years away.

The main and most important topic described in this **Deus Ex** is human augmentation, in this case — mechanical, later — on a nano scale with microscopic robots able to manipulate matter on an atomic scale. Even now scientists and doctors seek ways to help people with disabilities using prostetic legs and arms of ever improving quality. Now, think about what could be achieved if we broadened these efforts into boosting the abilities of soldiers and even ordinary people.

Augmented arms able to lift and throw a truck. Superhuman legs allowing to run faster than any Olimpic athlete and jump over three meters high. Eyes with night vision, scanner, heads up display and targeting support. Lungs able to breathe water, resistant to any chemicals in the air. **Think about it**. These are just examples, and if you think of them as crazy, impossible ideas, look around. Compare the world of 1960 and 2010 and see how much changed during 50 years in technology, medicine and the way people live. It is not a madman's vision, it's happening **as we speak**.

The game presets some very believable scenarios, at least in terms of possible players on the interest board. We've got pro-augments, pro-human radicals fearing that tampering with human biology might prove catastrophic, and last but not least, Illuminati — read: politicians really into power, control and regulations over augs.

**Adam Jensen**, the protagonist, is a very heavily augmented ex-SWAT who got himself into this war for power — war long, interesting and full of secrets. Since I am a sucker for a great stories, I won't tell you anything else. *Sorry*, play the game yourself.

> I've never asked for this.

He may say during one of the conversations at the beginning. True, even though Jensen is one of the most augmented people in the entire game at this point of time, these artificial improvements saved his life. Hence, it's easy too see that, as with **any technology** up to this point, augmentations themselves are morally neutral. It is up to the people using them to be morally good or bad, to use them as tools of creation or destruction.

We can build nuclear power plants capable of producing clean and efficient energy, but we can also fire off nuclear warheads able to level entire cities. In the future, we could create a supersoldier — invisible, accurate killing machine, or allow humanity to prosper using the same augmentations (erasing any disabilities and diseases). Possibilities are endless.

Most of these problems are discussed in **Human Revolution** in great detail, so it truly could be a lesson for the future. There are four possible endings, each quite different, each supporting a different scenario, the way humanity might take.

If this interests you in any way, I recommend you [buy the game](http://store.steampowered.com/app/238010/), it is often on sale. Production values of this title are amazing, graphics are beautiful (I particularly love the golden hue around everything) and voice actors do a fantastic job.

You might wonder why there's **Social Cards** in the title. Well, wonder no more!

I included Open Graph and Twitter Card support for my blog. What is the meaning of this for you? In theory, better social sharing experience. What **Open Graph** does is that whenever you share a link to my article on Facebook (as it's the most popular OG user), you should get a nice, short description and image in addition to the link itself. There are more in-depth ways to integrate a website with Facebook, but I'm not going to implement them — too much of a hassle for a blog this small. Moreover, more JavaScript would slow me down, and as you may have noticed, the loading speed of **kubalojewski.pl** is way faster than most other sites, thanks to solutions and technologies I use.

**Twitter Card** (*summary* one) is also activated for this domain. The effect is similar to the **Open Graph**, but instead works with, well, Twitter. So share a link to my article there and everyone can get a little preview of what's inside just by clicking the tweet, without entering my website. **Nifty**.
