title: "Why Fonts Are Important"

description: "I am obsessed with typography. We see various fonts everyday in our lives and I'd think most of us are very pragmatic when it comes to them. We see a text, be it in a book, advertisement, on a computer or a beer bottle. These words mean something, but they want to tell you the same whether it's Arial, Helvetica or Times New Roman. So why do we use different fonts, why not stick with one and employ it as a workhorse in every single situation?"

I am obsessed with typography. We see various fonts everyday in our lives and I'd think most of us are very pragmatic when it comes to them. We see a text, be it in a book, advertisement, on a computer or a beer bottle. These words mean something, but they want to tell you the same whether it's **Arial**, **Helvetica** or **Times New Roman**. So why do we use different fonts, why not stick with one and employ it as a workhorse in every single situation?
	
### Classifications

First of all, there are a lot of types to choose from, each fitting a different scenario. One would not use a font popular in comic books while writing a thesis (same thing the other way around). Advertisements adopted big, flashy fonts created to attract attention, you don't necessarily want the same effect in an official letter to your boss.

There are several prominent type classifications which warrant a better description:

<img src="/images/serif.jpg">

* Serif - named for the features at the ends of their strokes, as you can see above; these fonts are mostly used in print
* Sans Serif - type without the classic *endings* mentioned above
* Slab - font with blocky, thick serifs, useful for headings, logos and such, rarely for body text
* Monospaced - this is the programmer's best friend, with each glyph designed to be the same width (originally used in typewriters because of technical limitations though)

As you can see, there are some significant differences between them (and these are only the major font types, so to speak). There are thousands of typefaces available at the moment and new ones are being designed constantly.

### Emotions

Each font makes reading text a bit different, the perception changes along with the characters. That's why Readability or even iBooks provided many fonts to choose from when reading an article or a book. Some people prefer *cleaner* and more modern look of sans serifs like **Source Sans Pro** while others love all the curves of **Crimson Text**.

**Source Sans Pro** was designed by Adobe's Paul D. Hunt and it is a very beautiful, functional sans serif. It's worth mentioning not only because it's so good, but also a first open source font family from Adobe. Great for interfaces.

**Crimson Text**, on the other hand, is made by Sebastian Kosch. It is an absolutely gorgeous, classic typeface focused on book production and printing. I used it on this blog in its' previous iteration, so some of you might remember it.

At the moment though, you are looking at **Ubuntu** font. This one is a lovely sans serif designed by Dalton Maag foundry for the Ubuntu OS. It, too, is open source, supports many script systems and was funded by Canonical on behalf of the Open Source community. I use it on my blog since the last redesign and I think it's going to stay for a while. I was trying out different options recently, including Source Sans Pro, but I decided against it — Ubuntu's got much more personality. It is not a typical sans serif, it has its' own style, a little edge, some curves here and there. Obviously it is not perfect everywhere — I can't write code with it and, to my suprise, I don't like how it looks on my iPad as a system font (but I believe this is because of the Light style, I prefer Regular).

The above screenshot illustrates how I write my blog posts. I use Sublime Text, which I believe defaults to **Consolas** on Windows, which is an amazing monospace by Microsoft for its' post-Vista products. I also utilize [MacType](https://code.google.com/p/mactype/), a little app that changes the rendering on Windows to be much more similar to Mac OS X — resulting in so much better reading experience.

There are tons of fonts, each of them with their own personality and traits, so there is **absolutely** no reason to stick with one (hi, Helvetica), or not to change it up a bit every once in a while — just to make things fresh. So, whether you design a blog, write a letter to a loved one or a thesis for your professor, choose a different typeface for each one. It's worth it.
