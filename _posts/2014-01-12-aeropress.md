Finally, I got myself **Aeropress**, a coffee maker I wanted to buy for a few last months, if not half a year. It was always highly praised on the internet and among some of my more serious coffee-addicted friends — valued even higher than classic stovetop *mokas* all generations of Italians know and love. As a product of 2005, invented & made in the US of A, it certainly is a modern way to brew your favorite morning drink.

### So what is Aeropress, exactly?

As you can see on the picture I've taken for you, there are just a few parts and the whole idea is remarkably simple. So, the **Aeropress** system components are as follows:

* chamber, holding the coffee itself
* plunger with the rubber seal
* a set of paper filters in a holder, as well as the plastic filter cap
* scoop, stirrer and funnel (the last one is mostly useless to me at the moment)

That's it. You can have an amazing coffee in less than 3 minutes with this device. It is very strong, as I like it, but much less acidic than drip coffee. 
Obviously, you won't get a real espresso out of this, but sweet baby Jesus, it makes a world of a difference when everyone around you is drinking Nescafé. There are several methods of preparing the brew, different from each other mostly in tiny details, as everyone has different tastes. The **main idea**, however, remains the same.

**Note**: One can use traditional and *inverted* style, I prefer the latter, since it gives the coffee more time in the chamber.

### A tutorial, if you like

As this is not a stovetop, then clearly, one has to boil the water. Be sure, though, to end up with around **80 degrees C**, no more, this ain't instant coffee. It is a good practice to heat your cup now, just fill it with hot water for a few seconds. While you're at it, pour some of the water to the cup through the filter placed in the cap — it will stick and the brew won't taste like paper. 

Then, if you do it yourself, grind your beans (paper filter setting). I have yet to acquire a grinder, so shame on me, but I manage on pregrinded coffee and it isn't the worst thing in the world, so don't worry. Just pick a good brand, even when priced a bit higher.

Next step is to connect the plunger to the chamber and turn the thing **upside down** (the inverted method I mentioned). Fill up with the coffee (I use one Aeropress scoop), then with hot water up to about a half, stir, then again water to the end. Stir after like 10 seconds, then place a filter cap (with a filter in it) up top, turn it around and push, very much like a syringe. Done.
Cleaning up is even easier. For all visual oriented folks, here's a video demonstration.

So far, I am totally in love with it. I'm going to take some photos, probably tomorrow, of the preparation myself, so I can show you what's what. Until then, have a nice day and drink some tasty coffee yourself!
