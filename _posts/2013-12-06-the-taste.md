As you might have found out in your life, food preferences change depending on your surroundings, age or even cooking skills and knowledge. First of all, it is actually really good that it happens, it keeps our lives away from boredom and I think everyone likes to discover something new and *incredibly* tasty. Still, there are food products that are not, at least generally, considered luscious by the *most* people. A good example here are **ants** (yes, the insects), widely popular in South America, sold in little tidy packages ready to eat. Delicious. Seriously, I'd be willing to try!

The food I'm going to talk about here is not **that** exotic, though. Yes, it's not as popular as the *mainstream* food, it's likely more expensive, but also considered much more &mdash; let's say &mdash; elite, appealing to connoisseurs. To be completely frank, I am going to write about **alcohol**.

### Wine

This old and very popular drink will serve as a first suspect. It's safe to say that every adult have at least tried it once, if not more. Wine, however, is a difficult beast in a sense that it's different everywhere. Italian, French, Chilean, American, Spanish, Romanian, you name it. Stereotype is that the one made in France is the best, at least that's what French would like us to believe. You can buy wines made wholesale, commercially, bottled by the thousands and found in a supermarket. On the other end of the spectrum, you can get premium wines created in small but highly specialized vineyards.

Now, it's not a secret that commercially produced wines are terrible. **Most** certainly are, but at least some are drinkable. Nevertheless, I'm going to base my argument on wine taste on my own experience (as per usual) in a nice, small vineyard located near Venice, Italy. It is called [Parco del Venda](http://www.parcodelvenda.com/eng/). I am not sure if they are willing to ship their products to you, but I think I'm going to try soon since it's been a year and I miss their wines &mdash; I'll keep you posted.

There are certain kinds of wine available there and obviously, each one is different in *taste, structure, smell, bubbles* (if any) and *colour*. Moreover, one likely drinks wine with food, and hence it is important that the wine matches (and quite possibly enhances) the taste of the dish itself &mdash; so you must be careful and possess some knowledge if you are to call yourself a *sommelier* (a professional educated in wine-food pairing). Let me give you some examples, some obvious, some less.

*Fior d'Arancio* is a delicious, fantastic wine for pretty much everyone. Yet, the owner of the vineyard was terribly upset about it since it's so easy to appreciate. Anyone likes this one because it's sweet, tasty, has bubbles and so on. Other wines have much harder lives when it comes to acknowledgement, simply because they do not taste **that good** out of the box &mdash; but this is not what wines are about, is it? Drinking something like red *Boccon Cabernet* you have to give it a while to breathe, think about the experience, have some good capocollo on the side or even dark chocolate if you're not in the mood for meat.

The first wine is widely popular among my friends and family, the second &mdash; not very much, and yet it was *Boccon* that won the Grand Prix. It is harder to appreciate, you can't just drink it like milk in the morning (by itself) and expect magic to happen. There are people who get really disappointed very often because of this on many occasions in life &mdash; thinking *hey, people say this is great, I should try it* and then bam. Do it properly or don't do it at all. 

Of course, one might simply not like some food even after trying to find its secrets for a long time. This is what we call a personal taste.

### Beer

I want to follow with beer, one of my favourite drinks, both when I'm alone and socially. Situation is largely similar to wines, although I have to admit that the spectrum between utter piss and a great product is much larger in this case. In fact, low quality beers are the **most popular** by a large margin in most countries, especially in Poland. Surely the price plays a role here, but these beers are commercially brewed on a mass scale, so you have to understand that while they are not inherently bad, using the cheapest techniques and materials lowers quality, in most cases &mdash; severely.

There are, however, niche beers like *Żywiec Porter* pictured above. Żywiec is a huge company and one of the main producers in Poland. Its Baltic Porter is nonetheless brewed somewhere else &mdash; in Cieszyn, using old techniques and equipment from **1910**. The beer is **pitch black** and poured into a glass it has a huge chocolate brown head.  The flavour is really amazing, roasted malt, strong coffee, bitter chocolate &mdash; alcohol itself is hidden from taste despite 9,5% vol. I admit, I love this one and the fact that currently it is widely available in most better supermarkets.

Like in *Boccon*'s case, this beer receives high amount of criticism from, well, *normal* people. I think everyone I know with the exception of my brother and one friend hate this beer. The thing is &mdash; at least that's what I think &mdash; is that people are so used to the usual, **crappy** lager, that whenever comes a beer that's different (and I'm not counting radlers and flavoured beers) it is automatically rejected by the majority as a stupid idea (*what did you do to my beer?!*). Which is a pity, since this &mdash; hands down &mdash; is **one of the best** beers widely available in Poland, ask any foreigner who tasted more than twenty around the world.
