In politics and international relations the term "**morality**" appears very often: during many debates, implementing new laws or analysing the newest events. However, given that morality is an important and integral part of anyone's life, can one apply its code the same way while governing a country (ie. being the decision maker) or as part of some important international organization (**UN**, for example)? Can the same motives drive one's private life—responsible only for oneself—as politician's in the government, in charge of providing prosperity and security to millions? You have to answer these and similar questions while thinking about the way *high-level* decisions, domestic or foreign in effect, are made. There are two broad categories of thinking: conservative and liberal - **realistic** and **idealistic**, which must be considered for that purpose.

### Realism

This is one of the most important terms in international relations, containing, among other things, moral instructions for people in power. It is a catalogue of very pragmatic solutions, showing the world as it is, without unnecessary idealization; assuming the existence of many paradigms presenting large scale politics as disconnected from moral norms—ruled only by pure business, notable gains and *raison d’État*.

Now, according to the concept of **international anarchy**, there’s no universal sovereign or worldwide state—only relations between governments themselves are significant and each one can count only on itself in the event of emergency. The omnipresent power politics are almost mandatory as realists think of war as of a natural state, and of people — after **Hobbes** — as of evil and selfish by nature.
Hence, one can’t judge war in moral terms, as well as de facto laws, because the only thing that matters is the solution of the conflict. It doesn’t have to be just nor honorable, *it’s all about the result* in the end, so as long as profits outweigh the losses for a country, all effective actions are worthy of consideration and implementation — *no matter* their moral implications or even public opinion around the world. Public opinion itself cannot prevent aggressive government actions ([Mukden/Manchurian Incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukden_Incident) is a good example), so why would one care about it fighting for their own interests?

There’s a concept of cyclical history in realism, which also plays a role in this argument—let’s say that past events indeed repeat themselves: wars broke out in the past and the same will happen in the future for the same or similar reasons. Hence, it is really hard to try and work out long-term peace treaties (as they are *morally* positive) as well as multilateral alliances or unions — since they are doomed to collapse. Both the **self-help system** and even the concept of **Darwinism** reinforce that idea. First of all, a nation-state cannot count on anything else but itself and realism teaches that it should always be prepared for the lack of any support from the other countries in the event of a critical security risk. Any state is struggling to survive in the world, the international arena, and very often—pretty much whenever possible— it is at the *expense of another*. When it comes to the survival of a nation or its well-being, morality and *fair play* have simply no right to exist in high-level politics. **History is written by the victors**.

> There are things on which there is a complete consensus in the elite culture: the United States is **permitted** to carry out war crimes, it’s **permitted** to attack other countries, it’s **permitted** to ignore international law. Well, by the principles of the Nuremberg trials, every single American President since then would have been hanged. Has anyone ever been brought to trial? Has this point even been raised? It’s not a difficult point to demonstrate. <br> &mdash; <cite>Noam Chomsky — “[Understanding Power](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1565847032/qid=1013365358/sr=8-1/understandi04-20)”</cite>

Self-help however — even given that it deprives of any hope of outside help—is a perfect tool to maintain (territorial, energy, etc) security, keeping the country ready for anything.

### Idealism

Now, the opposite of realism in the international relations’ theory is idealism and revolutionism. It displays rather **Utopian** assumptions and manifests itself as non-probable. Hovewer, these assumptions are what most people would like to believe in, presenting the world they’d like to live in, which are — given a lot of work and changes — possible to implement and make real. Morality is defined as universal for anyone, no matter one’s religious beliefs or codes, thereby promoting the moral unity of the human race. Moreover, simple assumption that humans are inherently good *completely* changes the way we look at international relations and politics.

A morally good politician would care not only about one’s country’s prosperity, but also neighbors and others with whom one does business—not only because of pure benefits of the welfare of those, but out of pure kindness and the belief that it should be done. Countries would also **condemn the use of war** as a policy tool and instead use the assortment of *soft power*. It weakens such countries, however, versus those using power politics—although, especially recently, it might not be the case, as conventional warfare is less and less profitable by virtue of innumerable interdependences of peaceful democracies (and not only: for example, **China**), relying on themselves economically - see [a cobweb theory vs billard balls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations_theory). Nevertheless one cannot rule out possibility of a conventional attack and strict adherence to moral principles by people in power may prove to be fatal for their country.

In contrast to the realism, according to idealists history unfolds in a linear fashion - so it is possible to establish a perpetual peace, without war and with coexisting nations. To date, however, it’s hard to recall the example of a peaceful alliance founded purely out of goodwill that has survived at least one major test (the **League of Nations** is a fine example here). Moreover, while the LN was founded in a very idealistic spirit, in order to keep the peace around the world (which was morally positive), the country of its chief designer, **Woodrow Wilson’s**, was not a member. US Senate voted not to join on 19th of November 1919, apparently putting raison d’État of their own nation above rather idealistic, altruistic and utopian motives of the president. Currently, the **European Union** could be regarded as an organization serving the unity of nations, peace and common moral values​​. It is primarily based on economic and political cooperation, so it’s hard to say that the states are members simply out of good will to be one big family. Nevertheless, it is a huge step forward in the “*moral politics*". Never before have the nations of Europe, fighting with each other for centuries, formed the so huge and long-term cooperation pact. How long will it survive and whether it develops more remains a matter of speculation, especially since the EU possesses an arsenal of mostly soft power, without spending a substantial fraction of its income on traditional, realistic hard power (army)—reflecting the belief in moral, peaceful solutions.

### A bit of both?

Moral code is important. Whether politicians act according to their conscience or against it affect the fate of the country and its neighbors. But should we always follow the moral code? Not really, and not in every case. Keep in mind that morality is different around the world and what is bad for the Pole may not be a cause for concern for the Chinese. Moreover, the overriding interest of each country is to survive and ensure the safety of its own citizens - as such, any government cannot fully trust another state at any point. Ours is the most peaceful time in history for democratic[^1] countries, but it’s not like war will never break out and the allies won’t turn away from one another. Soft power is one thing, but it’s still not the time of complete trust and and unconditional support from neighbors.

Although there are many idealistic solutions in the world, it is wise to remain realistic being a politician, to be prepared for any eventuality and be able to defend one’s country. This **does not** mean getting rid of morality, the person occupying high public office must have high moral standards—but in foreign relations one should shake with one hand, yet the other must be ready for a possible defense—without **unnecessarily** assuming good intentions of your partner. Therefore, a clear distinction needs to be made between moral demands placed upon the average citizen and the head of state - a person who clearly and specifically **should** be able to make difficult decisions.

[^1]: there’s no such thing as a democracy, and democracies can commit even more war crimes than totalitarian countries, especially US, but that’s another story for another time
