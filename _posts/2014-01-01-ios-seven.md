After a long while I finally installed the newest iteration of Apple's mobile OS. To my suprise, there's no immediate *I hate it* reaction, that's always a good thing when it comes to radical user interface changes. It is not perfect though and I believe there's much to be done — in terms of visuals **and** functionality both. I'm going to present my feelings towards the software starting from the visual side of things.

### Oh Look, Shiny

Well, let's begin with the whole visual makeover. The question whether I like it or not is hard, since I only used iOS 7 for a day or so. Still, it's safe to say that it varies on app to app basis. For example, I absolutely love that every application not using fullscreen mode has the ability to color the status bar so it fits with the rest of the UI. Facebook is blue up top, Safari white and the homescreen adapts to your wallpaper. **Finally**.

> In all previous versions of iOS, the status bar was pitch black and ever-present unless you played a fullscreen game or something.

I also really like the parallax effects on wallpapers, all new dynamic wallpapers — which, I hope, are just a preview of what's coming, since there's only a few of them and they differ only in color.

Not everything is rosy, however, since I absolutely hate what they've done to both Newsstand and iBooks. Jesus Christ, why was wood bad? We place books on wooden shelves because they look pretty, we don't use some cheap ass plastic replacements — even in modern houses. Books looked so much better in previous surrounding. Yes, I know, it's a screen one only sees for a few seconds before actually tapping on a book to read, but it was so, so nice and they **royally fucked it up**. 

Did I mention stock icons (see Safari) look much worse than before? They are all simplified, to the point of really basic shapes. One guy actually created mentioned [Safari icon using Microsoft Word in 4 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJKsZzOgVfI). Try harder, Apple?

To be completely honest, I liked iOS 6 look much more, despite it being old, skeuomorphic and whatnot. Of course it needed a makeover, a change of some sort, but iOS 7 — however nice — is not an upgrade in the visual department. It seems rushed, it's way too bright and I really hope they will improve on this work in future updates.

### Pretend We're Working

Overall, functionality of the iOS have been improved in this update. Siri is much more human-like in terms of her speech and no longer sounds like some extreme text-to-speech converter. Moreover, the assistant supports more commands, like Wikipedia and Twitter searches. New control center and notification center are both amazing, well remade — especially the first one. It's no suprise that both are inspired by Cydia modifications that allowed essentially the same stuff to run on previous iOS iterations, still, it's good that Apple looks that way too.

Most Apple apps are pretty much the same, apart from the visual changes. There are some tweaks here and there, but nothing to write home about. As Apple is going to force iOS 7 requirement on all developers soon, there's no other option but to update. With the [recent release of the jailbreak](http://evasi0n.com/), however, not all is lost. Even if Apple won't fix their mistakes, some users will — like [BytaFont](http://www.bytafont.com/) team, who are porting their modification to the newest iOS. It allows to change the system font globally, so we could stop using this awful one we have at the moment (even old Helvetica was better!).

> Some people say you can get used to it, the more you use it. *Give it a few weeks*. I really hope that's the case.
