**Wednesday, 5th of February, 2014**. It's an average day, quite boring, nothing special to report, although there are some personal matters I can talk about. First of all, this Saturday there's going to be a party (of sorts), where me and my ex-classmates from secondary school are going to recall all of the cool moments together back in the day, eat, drink and have fun. A nice weekend coming up then, I hope.

I also passed all of my exams this session up to this point, one more to go (I'm not counting a 2-page long, trivial paper I have to write by Valentine's Day). Let's not forget the main, *work-in-progress* degree thesis though.

Then there's going to be a screening of the **FrackNation** documentary film in Warsaw next Thursday or Friday, courtesy of the Kosciuszko Institute, NGO I used to intern. Yours truly is attending, so expect a blog post from the event in case a lot of interesting stuff happens (which is likely, since a ton of *important people* are coming â€” government, embassies, corporations, you name it). This screening might come in handy later given my interest in **European Parliament's intership** I'm going to take part in this year. That's the plan, that is.

To the matter in the subject of this post then. Not much writing, but something to watch instead. Today I found a remarkable **TED** video, where **Ken Robinson** speaks about why the education system we employ today ruins creativity. Despite it being 8 years old now it continues to be an important, as well as existing, occurring issue. His speech is funny, interesting and you won't miss the 20 minutes that you spent on it.

Also a gem of a chestnut.
