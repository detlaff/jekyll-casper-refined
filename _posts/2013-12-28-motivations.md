I'm writing this as I should write my thesis, which is exactly why I picked this subject to talk about today. **Motivation**. Different people have different expectations, goals and ways to achieve them, but what drives them is important. Sometimes, though, there's nothing to lead us to victory and to success. How to deal with such a pickle?

Some of us thrive in doing stuff that is hard, myself included. Whenever I feel challenged by a particular issue, I feel like I absolutely have to deal with it, even better if I do it myself. Even in the tech aspect of my life that was always the case. Windows? No way, I tried all the Linuxes there were in my teenage years and still use Ubuntu to this day. WordPress? You're reading a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) blog. Same goes with gaming, cooking, even reading books harder that they should be. Somehow, though, I can't make myself to write that thesis. There are several reasons.

### Distractions

Yes, that's the obvious one. While I don't use Facebook pretty much at all these days, I am easily distracted by an article, a YouTube video or a game. There are times I even **look for this myself** so I don't have to work on the university paper, however stupid that behaviour is. I am completely aware that I won't get a lot of fun out of anything, because the spectre of the thesis is above me, but I still do *fun stuff*. This is never a nice feeling, as even the best things are shallow and empty. Deadline is getting closer and all you do is keep telling yourself you still got the time to make it work. That's what I always do and so far, it worked, for five years of my studies. However, the time has come for a grand finale.

### Consumerism

I firmly believe it's not hard to observe that we live in a society living off someone else's creation. Ask yourself what are you doing in your spare time. Television, blogs, YouTube, gaming, newspapers, radio. We all **consume**. An average modern human is *so addicted* to consuming, s/he freaks out whenever the source is taken away. Yes, we still go out, talk to people in real lives, but try cutting off the internet of an average teenager or even an older student. The internet, for good or bad, is what **we base our work and fun** on these days. This is fantastic for my thesis, for I can access sources never otherwise attainable, and yet on the other hand, I actually have to **create** that paper. I must create the content, which is really hard when you have so much other content to consume around you. This worldwide call to consume 24/7 is actually pretty terrifying, since it is hampering the creation process (needed for consumers too). What happens if I don't read this news piece, or listen to that song, or watch that video? **Absolutely nothing**. Why, then, do we always have to make ourselves do the job instead of *just* doing it?

### A Job

Of course, one may argue that the work I have assigned is not fun for me, that's why I wonder about motivations and that's why I lack one. True, but I have picked my thesis subject myself without any restrictions and believe me, it is very interesting. The thing is, I **hate** doing mandatory things. Whenever a task is not created by myself, but the other person **for myself**, I will most likely hate doing it. Why? I have no idea, maybe I'm just a rebel like that. I think the only way for me to enjoy the job is when I feel like this is the only true course of action. When I don't feel like I have to do this because my boss will kill me, but because this is how I feel it should be done. **This** is how you should motivate people like me, I believe. Give me a reason *why* this should be done, interest me more in the matter. In case of my thesis, I think I really could use a talk with someone else competent about my subject. Sadly, mission impossible for a few remaining days of the year.
